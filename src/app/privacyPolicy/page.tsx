                This Privacy Policy ("Policy") sets forth how Athlabs, located
                at 4132, Prestige Shantiniketan, Hoodi, Bangalore 560048, India
                ("Company"), handles the personal data of its users in relation
                to the services provided by the Athlabs app. The app offers
                AI-driven analysis of exercise performance through user-uploaded
                videos.

                1. Personal Data and Anonymity
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-5 text-white/70">
                "Personal Data" refers to any information that can directly or
                indirectly identify you. However, it is essential to clarify
                that while using Athlabs, your facial features and other
                identifiable markers in the videos are processed in such a way
                that your identity is not revealed. Our AI algorithms focus on
                analyzing your movement and exercise form, not on identifying or
                storing personal facial or bodily features.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-white/80">
                2. Use of Videos for App Improvement
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-2 text-white/70">
                When you upload a video to Athlabs, the app analyzes your
                exercise performance, providing instant, instructive feedback.
                This process involves capturing and processing video data to
                evaluate your movements and offer personalized exercise
                guidance.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2 text-white/70">
                The videos you upload may be used internally to improve the
                functionality and performance of the Athlabs app. By using our
                service, you consent to the use of your video data in this
                manner. These uses include enhancing the AIâ€™s accuracy and
                responsiveness, developing new features and services, and
                conducting research and development to better understand
                exercise patterns and performance.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-5 text-white/70">
                Although your videos are used to enhance our app, they are
                processed in a way that anonymizes any personal identification
                information. Faces and other identifiable features are obscured
                or removed to ensure privacy while retaining the data necessary
                for performance analysis.

              </h2>
              <p className="mb-2 text-white/70">
                By using Athlabs, you explicitly consent to the collection,
                processing, and use of your anonymized video data as described
                in this Policy. You have the right to withdraw your consent at
                any time, but this may affect the functionality of the services

                We take stringent measures to ensure the security and
                confidentiality of your data. The use of your video data is
